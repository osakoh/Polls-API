- Django Rest Framework(DRF): for access control, serialization, rate limiting and more.
DRF provides a well thought out set of base components and convenient hook points for building APIs.
DRF makes the process of building web API’s simple and flexible. With batteries included,
it has bases classes which allows data to be serialized and deserialized.

- Serialization: is making a streamable representation of the data that can be transferred over the network.
- Serialization: translates data structures/object state into a format that can be stored/transmitted & reconstructed later.
is its reverse process.
- Deserialization is the reverse of serialization.

Methods in PollSerializer class:
• A is_valid(self, ..) method which can tell if the data is sufficient and valid to create/update a model
instance.
• A save(self, ..) method, which knows how to create or update an instance.
• A create(self, validated_data, ..) method which knows how to create an instance. This method
can be overriden to customize the create behaviour.
• A update(self, instance, validated_data, ..) method which knows how to update an instance.
This method can be overriden to customize the update behaviour.
